# Double_check-
It's a code that runs through a directory and remove one copy of a duplicate file. It then downloads the latest version of the directory
Walk Through the Folder:

Use os.walk() or os.listdir() to traverse the target directory.
Identify Duplicates:

Use file hashes (e.g., MD5, SHA256) to compare files. Even if two files have the same name, their contents might be different, so we need a reliable way to check content.
We'll use the hashlib library to generate hashes for file content comparison.
Remove One of the Duplicates:

Keep a list of file hashes. If a file with the same hash already exists, delete it.
Zip the Folder:

After removing duplicates, we will compress the folder to allow for easy download.
